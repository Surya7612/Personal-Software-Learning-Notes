# Personal Software Learning Repository

This is my personal repository where I document my learning process and notes as I explore different software technologies. It is a private collection of my journey through various tools and frameworks for personal development and reference.

## What's Inside

Here, I maintain records and reflections on my learnings, including:

- Detailed notes on software like JIRA, AWS, Azure, etc.
- Code snippets and mini-projects I've developed to apply my understanding.
- Resources and important documentation that have aided my learning process.

## Structure

Each directory is dedicated to a specific software or technology, containing relevant materials and any applicable projects.

## Note

This repository is personal and is not intended for contributions. It serves as a digital logbook of my ongoing education in the field of software development.
